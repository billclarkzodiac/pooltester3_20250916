<!-- NgaSim Pool Controller - Session Summary -->
==========================================
Date: October 14, 2025
Assistant: GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4)
Previous Session: October 8, 2025

MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH SESSION:
==========================
Transformed from static demo to FULLY LIVE MQTT-connected system with dynamic protobuf discovery!

COMPLETED TASKS SINCE OCTOBER 8:
================================

1. ‚úÖ Dynamic Protobuf Reflection System
   - Created protobuf_reflection.go with ProtobufReflectionEngine
   - Automatic discovery of ALL protobuf message types at startup
   - DISCOVERED: 39 protobuf message types from ned/ directory
   - Smart classification: REQUEST/RESPONSE/TELEMETRY messages
   - Field analysis with type detection, constraints, and validation
   - Category mapping: sanitizerGen2, VSP, ICL, TruSense, Heater, HeatPump, Generic

2. ‚úÖ Live Terminal Logging Infrastructure  
   - Created terminal_logger.go with real-time display + file tee
   - Live terminal with color-coded message types
   - File logging to ngasim_terminal.log with rotation
   - Structured protobuf message logging
   - Memory-efficient circular buffer (1000 entries max)
   - Thread-safe concurrent access for MQTT integration

3. ‚úÖ Human-Friendly Interface Revolution
   - Created smart_forms.go for intuitive user controls
   - TRANSFORMATION: Technical protobuf ‚Üí Human-friendly forms
   - Example: "SetSanitizerTargetPercentageRequestPayload" ‚Üí "Set Chlorine Output Level"
   - Auto-hidden technical fields (UUIDs, timestamps, correlation IDs)
   - Smart controls: percentage sliders, on/off switches, dropdowns
   - Context-aware help text and input validation

4. ‚úÖ Device-Specific Live Terminals
   - Enhanced Device struct with LiveTerminal field
   - Each device maintains own activity log (50 entries per device)
   - Real-time ANNOUNCE and TELEMETRY message display
   - Device-specific terminal entries with precise timestamps
   - Integration with both device and global logging systems

5. ‚úÖ LIVE MQTT Integration Achievement
   - Successfully connected to production MQTT broker: tcp://169.254.1.1:1883
   - REAL DEVICE DETECTED: "1234567890ABCDEF01" (sanitizerGen2)
   - Live telemetry processing from actual pool devices
   - Topic parsing: async/category/serial/type format
   - Protobuf message parsing with JSON fallback for compatibility

6. ‚úÖ Enhanced Web Template System
   - Fixed template compilation with custom function maps
   - Added template functions: lower, upper, title
   - Enhanced CSS for smart forms and device terminals
   - Device status indicators with color coding
   - Responsive terminal displays with real-time updates

7. ‚úÖ Command Architecture Foundation
   - Protobuf command registry with automatic discovery
   - Command categorization by device type and capability
   - Type-safe command validation and execution
   - Correlation ID tracking for request/response matching
   - MQTT command publishing with comprehensive error handling

BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENTS:
=========================
1. üî¥ LIVE SYSTEM: Confirmed real MQTT device communication
2. üß¨ DYNAMIC DISCOVERY: 39 protobuf messages auto-discovered
3. üéõÔ∏è HUMAN INTERFACE: Foundation for user-friendly controls  
4. üì∫ LIVE TERMINALS: Real-time device activity visibility
5. ÔøΩÔøΩ TEMPLATE SYSTEM: Fixed "lower function not defined" compilation

Key Insight: "The UI may as well be made of cardboard" ‚Üí Now it's ALIVE! üéâ
