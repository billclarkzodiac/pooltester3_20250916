High-level summary of pollerBILL.c:

Purpose: Discover and poll “NGA” clients reachable over a Linux SLIP interface (sl0), and periodically broadcast a “Topology” message with current time, MQTT port, and a list of discovered devices. Optionally interleave a legacy RS-485 poll on a UART.
Concurrency model: fork() into two processes:
filter(): Opens a PF_PACKET raw socket bound to sl0 in promiscuous mode, attaches a BPF, and continuously reads packets. It:
Marks response/end-of-response flags on any inbound packet to help the poll loop time out.
Detects 60-byte “Announce” messages (magic 0x55 at offset 28) and records new clients (IP bytes and 18-byte serial).
poll(): Configures the SLIP serial port to high speed (115200), opens a UDP broadcast socket to 169.254.255.255:30000, and:
Every TOPOLOGY_SECS seconds, broadcasts a Topology message: current time (sec, ns), MQTT port (1883), device count, and per-device entries (IP low/high bytes, duplicate flag, 18-byte serial).
Iterates known clients and “polls” each by broadcasting a 4-byte message [169, 254, IP_msb, IP_lsb], then waits up to IDLE_POLL or MAX_RESPONSE_TIME depending on whether a response started (flags set by filter()).
Optionally performs a legacy RS-485 poll by temporarily switching the UART to 9600 baud and sending ENQ.
Shared state: Simple flags and a “new client” buffer are shared via anonymous mmap() between the two processes.
Linux-specific bits: PF_PACKET raw sockets, promiscuous mode, SO_BINDTODEVICE, BPF filter, custom ioctl to a SLIP kernel module (REG_CURRENT_TASK), and signal handling.
How to re-code this in Go (Linux-only):

Use goroutines instead of fork() and mmap() flags:
packetListener goroutine: reads PF_PACKET frames on sl0, updates atomic flags, and sends any new announcements over a channel.
poller goroutine: manages the clients set, sends periodic Topology broadcasts, and performs client polls with timeouts based on the flags.
Use github.com/mdlayher/packet for AF_PACKET (works with non-Ethernet interfaces like sl0) and a UDP socket with SO_BROADCAST for broadcasts.
Represent Topology messages as byte slices; pack fields in the same order as the C structs.
Stub or later implement the legacy serial poll (e.g., github.com/tarm/serial). The custom ioctl to your SLIP driver likely won’t be portable and may need Cgo if required.
Below is a minimal Go scaffold that mirrors the core functionality (packet capture, announce parsing, client tracking, topology broadcast, and polling). It is Linux-only and requires root or CAP_NET_RAW to read PF_PACKET and send broadcasts.
