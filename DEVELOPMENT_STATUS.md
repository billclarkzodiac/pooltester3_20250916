## ðŸŽ‰ MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Multi-Device Protobuf Support

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** âœ… SUCCESS - Smart duplicate resolution complete

### What Works:
- âœ… **4 device protobuf types** integrated successfully  
- âœ… **Device-specific messages** preserved (SanitizerInfoPayloads, etc.)
- âœ… **Common protocol messages** shared appropriately
- âœ… **Clean compilation** with no duplicate conflicts
- âœ… **Ready for protobuf reflection** and dynamic command generation

### Architecture Insight:
The key was recognizing that `InfoMessage` in each device file is 
**device-specific** (different payloads), not a true duplicate.

### Next Phase Ready:
- Dynamic device discovery via protobuf reflection
- Automatic command generation for new device types  
- Self-documenting device capabilities
- Perfect for retirement handoff! ðŸŽ¯
