I'll give a short, practical recommendation and a tiny example you can copy into your TOML/spec — plus a clear plan for how to implement it in the GUI.

### What I'm about to do
Explain a simple, robust approach to declare an index page (dashboard) and per-item sub-windows, show a compact TOML example, list the runtime wiring (frontend + backend), and suggest next steps.

### Recommended approach — declarative spec + dynamic component factory
* Keep UI structure declarative in a single machine-readable file (TOML/JSON/YAML). That file describes:
  * Index page layout (rows/columns or grid)
  * Index items (cards/icons) and which device types they represent
  * A mapping from an index item → sub-window spec (widgets, data bindings, controls)
  * Reusable widget definitions (type + parameters)
* On the frontend implement a small component factory/registry:
  * Map widget type names (e.g., dial, digital_display, toggle_button) to UI components.
  * The renderer reads the spec and instantiates components with given props and data-bind paths.
  * Per-device windows are ephemeral UI instances created when a dashboard item is clicked. They receive the device id (serial) and the sub-window spec; they fetch live state (via REST or WebSocket) and bind controls to server APIs.

Benefits:

* No code duplication (spec drives UI).
* Easy to add new device types/widgets by editing the TOML only.
* Server-driven: you can change UI without shipping frontend code (if widget types are stable).
### Minimal contract (2–3 bullets)
Input: spec file (TOML) describing dashboard and windows; runtime device state via APIs (/api/devices, /api/device/{serial}/state).
Output: rendered dashboard + per-device windows; per-device control actions posted back to APIs.
Error modes: missing widget type → show fallback; missing device state → show offline placeholder.

### Edge cases to handle
offline devices (show greyed card + last-seen)
widget types unknown to frontend (render “unsupported widget” placeholder)
rate-limiting user commands (server-side)
many devices (virtual paging or clustering of cards)

### Tiny TOML example you can drop into your spec
(you already have device_type blocks — this complements them with index + subwindow mapping)

```toml
# index layout
[index]
title = "Dashboard"
layout = "grid" # grid | list
columns = 4

# items shown on index - device cards generated from devices list
[[index.card]]
device_type = "sanitizerGen2"
title = "Sanitizer"
icon = "swc"
summary_fields = ["serial_number","status","current_output"]

[[index.card]]
device_type = "vsp"
title = "Pump"
icon = "pump"
summary_fields = ["serial_number","status","rpm"]

# Map a device_type -> sub-window (widgets rendered when card clicked)
[subwindow.sanitizerGen2]
title = "Sanitizer Details"

# widgets are resolved by the frontend component registry
[[subwindow.sanitizerGen2.widget]]
id = "gauge"
type = "dial"
label = "Power"
prop = "current_output"   # binding path from device state

[[subwindow.sanitizerGen2.widget]]
id = "ppm"
type = "digital_display"
label = "PPM"
prop = "ppm_salt"
fallback_wait = "WAIT"
fallback_off = "OFF"

[[subwindow.sanitizerGen2.widget]]
id = "power_controls"
type = "power_control_group"
label = "Power Controls"
# config for control: repeated send of power set, rate, default levels
repeat_send_seconds = 5
allowed_levels = [0,10,50,100,101]
```

### Runtime wiring (frontend + backend)
1. Backend serves:
* /api/ui/spec → the TOML parsed into JSON (or serve TOML raw)
* /api/devices and /api/device/{serial}/state → runtime device states
* /api/device/{serial}/command → accept control commands
2. Frontend:
* On load GET /api/ui/spec and /api/devices
* Render index by iterating index.card and generating one card per device (matching device_type)
* On click → open modal/window component, pass serial and subwindow.<device_type> spec
* The window component binds widget props to /api/device/{serial}/state (via polling or WebSocket)
* Control widgets POST to /api/device/{serial}/command and rely on server-side SanitizerController for validation & queuing
### Implementation plan (3 small steps)
1. Design the final TOML schema (index, card, subwindow, widget types). — I can draft this.
2. Add a small server endpoint to return the parsed TOML as JSON (/api/ui/spec). — trivial in Go.
3. Build a tiny frontend renderer (React/Vue) with a component registry to render widgets from the spec.
### Quick suggestion — keep widgets minimal first
Start with these primitives:

* label, digital_display, dial, toggle_button, button, indicator, group, input_number Then implement a single per-device window wired to sanitizer state as a prototype.
### Want me to do one of the following next?
* Draft a complete TOML schema for the UI (index + widget types) and convert the current spec into that schema (I can edit Device_Window_spec-20251002bc.toml).
* Implement a tiny /api/ui/spec endpoint in Go that returns the TOML as JSON.
* Build a minimal React demo (index + sanitizer window) that reads /api/ui/spec and /api/device/{serial}/state.

Pick one and I’ll add a short TODO and start. Which would you like me to do?
