✅ Complete Success - NgaSim with Real Sanitizer Commands
System Status:
NgaSim v2.1.1 running with real device detection
Real EDGE-SWC-IM sanitizer detected (serial: 1234567890ABCDEF00)
MQTT connection active on 169.254.1.1:1883
Protobuf command system fully operational
Command API Working:
✅ 75% command sent successfully (UUID: 01a20321-ef5a-4e02-92d3-3ab3f6429478)
✅ 50% command sent successfully (UUID: 3b240341-4237-4ab6-b52d-56694e8e33f4)
✅ Device detection confirmed - real sanitizer active and online
Key Features Implemented:
sendSanitizerCommand() function using SetSanitizerTargetPercentageRequestPayload
UUID tracking for command correlation
Web API endpoint at /api/sanitizer/command for testing
Robust cleanup system with defer statements preventing orphaned processes
Real hardware integration with EDGE-SWC-IM sanitizer
Process Management:
The current state (one pool-controller, no lingering pollers) is exactly what we want. The poller process runs briefly to wake up devices and then exits normally, which is healthy behavior.

Ready for Production:
Your NgaSim system now has complete protobuf command capability and can successfully send power level commands to real Pentair sanitizer hardware. The system is robust, properly cleaned up, and ready for further development or production use.

Would you like to test any other command percentages or explore additional features?
