**ðŸ“‹ Retirement Handoff Checklist:**  
 [ ] All device types compile âœ…  
 [ ] Comprehensive documentation for successor  
 [ ] Self-discovering device system (protobuf + reflection)  
 [ ] No hardcoded device types - purely dynamic  
 [ ] Clear architecture docs for future maintenance  

**This approach gives your successor a system that automatically handles new devices without code changes - just add protobuf files!**
