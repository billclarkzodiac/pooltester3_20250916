Pool Controller - 2025-10-07  -- NgaSim v2.1.1

Summarized recent changes and status


Built and verified changes

go build -o pool-controller
Build completed successfully. The updated `main.go` template changes and new handlers compile cleanly and the binary `pool-controller` was produced.

./pool-controller
If you run the binary (no helper scripts), the web UI will be available at http://localhost:8082 by default.

Recent edits performed in this session

**Files changed / added**
- `main.go` — Replaced the old GUI template with a new dashboard + popup layout (matches `Device_Window_wireframe.svg`). Added client-side JS to fetch `/api/devices`, open a device popup, and POST sanitizer commands to `/api/sanitizer/command`.
- `main.go` — Added server routes and handlers:
  - `POST /api/exit` (handleExit) — redirects client to `/goodbye`, runs cleanup, performs graceful HTTP shutdown and exits the process.
  - `GET  /goodbye` (handleGoodbye) — serves a small "Goodbye" page that attempts to auto-close the tab and shows a manual-close fallback.
  - Registered the new routes in `startWebServer()`.
- `Device_Window_wireframe.svg` — SVG wireframe (created earlier) used as the design target for the new layout.
- `Device_Window_diagram.mmd` — Mermaid diagram (created earlier) illustrating Dashboard → per-device popup layout.
- `Device_Window_spec-20251002bc.toml` — TOML UI spec (created earlier) retained and preserved; workspace settings were adjusted to prevent TOML format-on-save from stripping comments.

**Behavioral and UX changes**
- New web-based dashboard: 3-column device card grid, per-device overlay popup with gauge, PPM box, quick power buttons (OFF, 10%, 50%, 100%, BOOST), and device info.
- Big red "EXIT" button in header wired to confirmExit() which POSTs `/api/exit`.
- `handleExit` now:
  - Issues an HTTP redirect to `/goodbye` so the browser shows a clear shutdown page.
  - Calls `n.cleanup()` to stop the C poller (if running), disconnect MQTT, and close loggers.
  - Attempts graceful HTTP shutdown via `n.server.Shutdown(ctx)` with a short timeout, then exits the process.
- `handleGoodbye` attempts to call `window.close()` after a short delay; if the browser blocks it, it shows a friendly message asking the user to close the tab manually.

What I verified

- `go build -o pool-controller` completed with no compile errors.
- Confirmed code paths exist for `/api/sanitizer/command`, `/api/exit`, and `/goodbye`.
- Stopped earlier background `pool-controller` and `poller` processes during this session and verified no lingering processes remained.

Why the web EXIT looks different from a Tkinter exit

- Web-based UI runs in the browser (a separate process). Browsers restrict script-initiated tab closing unless the tab was opened by script. To provide a good UX we redirect to `/goodbye` and attempt `window.close()` from there; if blocked, the page instructs the user to close the tab manually.

How to test the shutdown flow locally

1. Start the app (in a terminal):

```bash
cd /home/test/projects/pooltester3_20250916
./pool-controller
```

2. Open the dashboard at http://localhost:8082.
3. Click the red EXIT button, confirm the dialog.
   - The browser will be redirected to `/goodbye`.
   - Server logs should show: "Exit requested via /api/exit - initiating graceful shutdown", then cleanup logs and "HTTP server shut down cleanly" or "Exiting process now".
4. Verify process has stopped: `pgrep -a pool-controller` (should return nothing).

Quick process checks

```bash
# check for pool-controller
pgrep -a pool-controller || ps aux | grep pool-controller | egrep -v grep
# check for poller
pgrep -a poller || ps aux | grep poller | egrep -v grep
```

Next recommended steps (pick any)

- Serve assets: expose `Device_Window_wireframe.svg` and `Device_Window_spec-20251002bc.toml` via endpoints (e.g., `/static/ui-wireframe.svg` and `/api/ui/spec`) so frontends or designers can fetch them directly.
- Implement a TOML loader: parse the TOML spec into typed Go structs and return JSON from `/api/ui/spec` so a dynamic frontend can render widgets from the spec.
- Protect `/api/exit`: restrict it to localhost or require a short token printed at startup to prevent accidental remote shutdowns.
- Add a small status indicator in the UI that shows "Shutting down..." when exit is requested (improves feedback).

If you want me to, I can implement any of these next steps. I can also scan recent log files (`app.log`, `device_commands.log`) and extract shutdown/poller-related events if you want a precise timeline.
