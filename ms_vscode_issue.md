scode ssh failed us by corrupting main.go   which you recovered,   but now I want to know is it safe to use vscode's ssh remote server mode for edit and debug OR  is microsoft still fixing vscode   OR   is microsoft just ignoring the users who want to use remote mode of vscode ???

======================

That's a great question about VS Code's SSH remote development reliability. Based on my knowledge and experience helping developers:

VS Code SSH Remote Development Status (2024-2025)
Microsoft is actively maintaining and improving VS Code Remote Development, not ignoring it. Here's the current situation:

Safety Assessment: Generally Safe with Precautions
✅ What's Working Well:

Core SSH remote functionality is stable for most users
File editing, debugging, and terminal access work reliably
Extensions generally work well in remote mode
Performance has improved significantly over the years
⚠️ Known Issues Still Being Fixed:

File corruption during poor network conditions (what you experienced)
Occasional connection drops with large files
Some extension compatibility issues
Memory usage can be high on remote servers
Microsoft's Current Focus:
Active Development: Regular monthly updates to Remote-SSH extension
Performance Improvements: Ongoing work on connection stability
Bug Fixes: Network-related file corruption issues are being addressed
New Features: Continuous improvement of remote development experience
Best Practices to Avoid Your Issue:
Always use Git or version control (which saved you!)
Enable auto-save with delays to reduce corruption risk
Use stable network connections when possible
Keep backups of critical files
Monitor connection quality - disconnect/reconnect if unstable
Alternatives to Consider:
Local development with rsync/scp for deployment
Docker containers for consistent environments
GitHub Codespaces for cloud-based development
Traditional SSH + vim/nano for quick edits
Recommendation:
VS Code SSH remote is safe to use with proper precautions. Your corruption was likely due to network instability during the SSH session. The fact that git saved you shows the importance of version control as a safety net.

Microsoft is definitely not ignoring remote development - it's a key strategic feature they continue to invest in heavily.

Would you like me to help you set up some additional safety measures for your remote development workflow?
