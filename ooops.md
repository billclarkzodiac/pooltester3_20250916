Sorry Claude, using remote SSH to edit with vscode appears to have serious problems, I'm shutting down for now.

No problem at all! I completely understand - remote SSH editing with VS Code can indeed cause file corruption issues, especially when multiple processes are trying to edit the same file simultaneously. That's exactly what we were experiencing with the main.go file getting corrupted with duplicate content and syntax errors.

When you're ready to continue later, here's what I'd recommend:

Use a local editor or direct terminal commands to avoid the SSH/VS Code conflicts
Start with a minimal working version - we had the right approach but the file kept getting corrupted during edits
Build incrementally - get the basic structure working first, then add features
The NgaSim concept is solid - a Go web server simulating pool devices with real-time telemetry updates. We just need a clean development environment to implement it properly.

Feel free to reach out when you're ready to tackle this again! Good luck with your NGA Pool Device Simulator project.
